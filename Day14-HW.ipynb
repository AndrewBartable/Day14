    "**Q1** The pros and cons of using algorithms to make decisions for the human world can greatly vary. On the pros end I can see how algorithms can simplify our lives. This could save us a lot of time and money by making aspects of our lives or even businesses more efficient. Cons however would be that certain algorithms can be manipulated for the gain of a business or individual. Discriminatory hiring or application acceptance of schools and jobs can easily reject and filter by race, ethnicity, background, gender, etc. Overall I view the discussion of biased algorithms to be an aimportant talking point. Although I would say we can never have a truly unbiased algorithm I would say its important to try to have one close to neutral in order to avoid potential harms and risks. "

    "**Q2** The way I try to make good decisions is by a lot of contemplation. I usually review my own thoughts and actions. Sometimes I consult others for advice. I try to give myself time before I made a decision which could potentially be good or bad. Using that time gives me a chance to review it essentially weighing pros and cons. Discussing with tohers helps a lot too."

I would then try to reach out to them in a friendly manner and point out said bias or offer a reccomendation on how they can improve their work. It doesn't have to be academic it could also be a world view someone holds. I would try to challenge it a bit and offer a different perspective as to maybe open their mind a bit on the situaiton."

    "2. This book looks at ethical challenges and responsibilities that come with vreating algorithms in modern day society. Algorithms are seen to have great influence in many areas such as privacy. How algorithms are involved in everyday lives. How it impacts areas such as such hiring, college admission, loan approvals, and criminal sentencing. \r\n",
    "\r\n",
    "They book also suggests how we can create better algorithm using certain strategies for making them more transparent, better at protecting privacy, and in reducing biases. Strategies such as differential privacy and fairness constraints are spoken of. The main message of the book is that an ethical AI isn't just a philosophical iss,e; it's a scientific challenge which requires engineers and developers to carefully design these algorithms themselves. Pretty good book overa\n",
    "3. It was a good read in all honesty. I haven't given ethics ai or data algorithms much thought. I always knew it was a challenge but I didn't know to what extent. I now see of course how deep of implications it has. It really makes me wonder how technology will develop with this in mind (if companies and businesses are even greatly considering it). I agree with the author overall that ethical ai should be put into practice. I agree that this challenge is both a scientific and philosophical issue that involves great analysis on both ends. It also opened my eyes a lot to how easily my information and privacy are compromised online. Obviously thats something I care about. But then it poses a dillema of sorts. How much privacy are you willing to give up to use technology? If we want to use tech that can simplify our lives, make it more efficacious and easier, or cater to us more, that requires a sacrifice of privacy. So how much privacy are we willing to give up for these services?llll"
